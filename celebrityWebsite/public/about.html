    <h2>About Chew Soo Wei</h2>
    <p>Chew Soowei is a Singapore-based live show-host with more than a decade of 
        experience on stage. She is a well-known figure and sought-after female 
        show-host in the media and entertainment industry. Her first foray and 
        passion is “Radio”, a medium she devoted herself to since the very first 
        live radio show she presented for Radio Heatwave, Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s 
        campus radio station. After graduating, she dived right into the industry 
        with a morning show on the former SPH channel, WKRZ, now 913fm. The next 
        station that she worked for gained her more experience in the business as 
        she helmed a double post in Safra Radio, hosting an afternoon time-belt and 
        juggling the music responsibility as a music programmer for Power98fm. She 
        eventually made a change to Mediacorp’s 987fm. She helmed “Say It With Music” 
        – Singapore’s longest-running dedication show. She also hosted a midnight 
        program popular among the youths called “Pillowfight.”</p>
            
    <p>Not limiting herself to presenting on Radio, she ventured into presenting 
        for live TV shows. She co-hosted with UTT &amp; Jonny on a local TV 
        music program called “Live n Loaded”. She is capable of juggling 
        demanding live broadcast challenges while keeping the audience 
        entertained with her bubbly and dynamic personality. Furthermore, she 
        also presented a live simultaneous feed on the web, with no script, 
        propelling her to a more mature and spontaneous style in front of the 
        camera. Soowei hosted the live TV broadcast for Channel 5’s celebration 
        countdown 2010 and 2011, sealing her credibility as a live and on-air 
        TV host. She is also the host for a web-based TV channel for LO-FI TV, 
        a local based music info capsule. Putting her dancing skills to the 
        test, she was a celebrity contestant in “Dancestar Asia”- a cable-based 
        reality dancing competition. When “Amazing Race Australia” was in town 
        for a shoot, Soowei hosted the pit stop challenge and stepped in as a 
        translator for the segment.</p>
        
    <p>Soowei is currently teaching “Radio” as a subject at her alma mater, 
        Ngee Ann Polytechnic amidst numerous side projects like blogging and 
        content development for various media academies. She is a fulltime 
        freelance emcee, part-time Brazilian jiu jitsu, muay thai and boxing 
        enthusiast and part-time travel-thrill adventure seeker.</p>
